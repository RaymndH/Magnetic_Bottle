# Magnetic_Bottle
This was a project intended to incorporate a couple of techniques in numerical integration and 
computational physics in order to simulate the trapping effect of the fields of a magnetic mirror
on an arbitrary charged particle.

At this time, it consists of two files: Old Magnetic Bottle.ipynb and magnetic_bottle.py.
The former was based on the original project writeup for a class taken in the spring, 
the latter is revised code which amended several critical errors and has been streamlined.
